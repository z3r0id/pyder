# Pyder attemps to simplify the first step in web app pentesting by:
#    - collecting valuable info
#    - scanning for basic vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, bad security settings, etc...)
#    - use collected information to present possible CVEs
#    - present an exportable report on findings

# Nothing in this scan should be trusted 100% and all uncovered vulnerabilities should be verified before finalizing.
